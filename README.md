# Oldagram

## Project Overview
**Oldagram** is a solo project from the Scrimba Essential CSS Concepts course. The goal of the project was to create a simple and accessible web page that mimics a social media post, complete with interactive elements like "like buttons" and hover effects.
Here is the required design

## Requirements
- **Create the First Post:** Designed a single post using semantic HTML to ensure accessibility and maintainability.
- **Use Semantic HTML:** Implemented semantic HTML elements to structure the content meaningfully.
- **Add Hover Effects to Icons:** Added interactive hover effects to the icons for better user experience.


## Stretch Goals
- **Increase Likes on Click:** Integrated JavaScript functionality to dynamically increase the number of likes when the like button is clicked.
- **Render All Three Posts:** Used JavaScript to automatically render multiple posts, allowing for a dynamic and flexible layout.
