# Oldagram

## Project Overview
**Oldagram** is a solo project from the Scrimba Essential CSS Concepts course. The goal of the project was to create a simple and accessible web page that mimics a social media post, complete with interactive elements like "like buttons" and hover effects.
Here is the required design
